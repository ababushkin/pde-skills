# Brief template

Each Now artefact gets a brief written before authoring begins, just-in-time as the artefact enters the queue. Briefs for Next items are written only at promotion time. Owner authors briefs.

## Format

Each brief starts with a plain-English summary paragraph for owner review, followed by the YAML block for agent use.

**Summary paragraph** — 3–5 sentences before the YAML. States: what the artefact does, when it fires, key scope boundary, any non-obvious decisions for the owner to confirm. Written in the pack's direct register. No YAML, no bullets.

For `new` artefacts, the `prior_art_notes` block uses `n/a` for keep/change/do_not_copy.
