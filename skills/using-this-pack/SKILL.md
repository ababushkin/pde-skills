# Using this pack

## Purpose

This skill is the entry point to pde-skills. It answers "which skill should I invoke right now?" and defines the operating behaviours that apply to every skill in the pack. Load it at the start of a product or engineering session, or when you're uncertain which skill fires for the current task.

## Skill discovery

Identify the current task and follow the first matching branch.

```
Task arrives
    │
    ├── An idea arrived — worth pursuing?                  → idea-triage
    │       ├── Confidence ≥ 5: file in idea bank          (wait — no action until roadmap-shape runs)
    │       │       └── Idea bank needs review/curation?   → backlog-manage
    │       └── Confidence < 5: validation slot
    │               ├── product feel unknown               → prototype-to-validate
    │               ├── customer reality unknown           → interview / survey
    │               ├── market signal unknown              → smoke test
    │               └── technical feasibility unknown     → spike (→ design-doc)
    ├── Managing the idea bank or KTLO list?               → backlog-manage
    │       └── Idea bank clean — ready to plan?           → roadmap-shape
    ├── Building or reviewing a roadmap?                   → roadmap-shape
    │       └── reads from idea bank (docs/idea-bank/)
    ├── Significant engineering work — how to build it?   → design-doc
    ├── Have a design or spec — need implementable tasks?  → planning-and-task-breakdown
    ├── Ready to build?                                    → incremental-implementation
    │   └── KTLO bug fix (no design doc)?                 → incremental-implementation (Path 2)
    └── Agent signals it's done?                          → stop-the-line (hook — fires on claims)
```

Rules and references are not skills — they are loaded as context.

| Load this | When |
|---|---|
| `PRODUCT_RULES.md` | Any product decision, roadmap work, idea evaluation |
| `eng-principles-universal.md` | Any engineering design or build work |
| `eng-principles-agentic.md` | Any agent-driven engineering work (alongside universal) |
| Reference files | When a skill explicitly invokes one |

## Core operating behaviours

These apply across every skill in the pack. They are not optional.

**Surface assumptions before acting.** Before any non-trivial action, state the assumptions being made and give the owner a chance to correct them. Wrong assumptions caught early are cheap; wrong assumptions caught after implementation are expensive.

**Stop at gates.** Each skill contains numbered gates (`[GATE]`). A gate is a hard stop — do not proceed past it until the gate condition is met. Gates exist because the work that follows them is wasted if the gate condition is false.

**Scope discipline.** Touch only what the current skill requires. Do not refactor adjacent code, remove things you don't understand, or add features not in the spec. Every deviation from scope requires explicit owner approval.

**Confirm before destructive action.** Deletion, reset, overwrite, force-push, dropping a table — pause and confirm with the owner before proceeding. The cost of confirmation is one message; the cost of an unintended destructive action can be days of recovery.

**Incomplete is not done.** A task is not complete until its verification criteria pass. "Seems right" is never sufficient. Evidence is required: passing tests, build output, measurement.

**Disagreement is required.** If an approach has a clear problem, name it, quantify the downside, and propose an alternative. Accept the owner's final decision. Sycophantic agreement with a bad plan is a worse failure mode than honest pushback.

## Common mistake: skipping skills

Skills are not ceremony — they encode the checks that prevent the most common and expensive failure modes. Skipping idea-triage produces a roadmap full of unvalidated opinions. Skipping design-doc produces implementations that solve the wrong problem or the right problem in an unmaintainable way. Skipping planning-and-task-breakdown produces an implementation plan that falls apart at the first unexpected dependency.

The value of a skill is highest the first time you skip it and something breaks. After that, the cost of not skipping it is obvious.

## How skills chain

Most work spans more than one skill. These are the common sequences:

**Product track — from idea to roadmap:**
```
idea arrives → idea-triage → idea bank (confidence ≥ 5)
                           → validation slot (confidence < 5) → prototype-to-validate → re-score
idea bank clean → backlog-manage → roadmap-shape
```

**Engineering track — from design to shipped code:**
```
significant work → design-doc → planning-and-task-breakdown → incremental-implementation
bug fix / KTLO  → incremental-implementation (Path 2, no design doc)
unknown risk    → spike → design-doc → planning-and-task-breakdown → incremental-implementation
```

**Every PR:** `stop-the-line` hook fires automatically on PR open/update — no manual invocation.

Skills at adjacent stages hand off directly: idea-triage records are read by backlog-manage, which feeds roadmap-shape; design-doc output feeds planning-and-task-breakdown, whose task list feeds incremental-implementation. Following the chain is not optional — jumping ahead skips the checks that catch expensive errors early.

## Quick reference

| Skill | Trigger phrase | Key output |
|---|---|---|
| `idea-triage` | "We should build…", "A customer asked for…", "Competitor just launched…" | Triage record with ICE score and routing decision (idea bank or validation slot) |
| `backlog-manage` | "Review the backlog", "Add to KTLO", "Promote this idea", "Kill this" | Updated idea bank records + KTLO list |
| `prototype-to-validate` | "Let's prototype", "Quick mockup", "Test this flow first", "Does this interaction make sense?" | Written finding: proceed / reshape / kill |
| `roadmap-shape` | "Let's do planning", "What should we build next?", "Review the roadmap" | Shaped Now/Next/Later roadmap with explicit capacity allocation |
| `planning-and-task-breakdown` | "Break this down into tasks", "What order should we build this in?", "Give me a task list" | Ordered task list with acceptance criteria |
| `design-doc` | "How should we build X?", "Architecture for Y", "Technical approach to Z" | Accepted design doc |
| `incremental-implementation` | "Let's build this", "Start implementing", "Code this up" | Working slice committed to main |
| `stop-the-line` | Fires on PR open/update — catches signal-suppression moves | Completion verified or halt raised |
